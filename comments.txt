I think you have a good, basic start here. I think that you need to make clear what the user's choices are for the input: right now, the user can type anything and there's no sense of what the response will be. So I think you need to look for ways to constrain user choice, perhaps by giving numbered choices ie "enter 1 for this kind of shirt" etc. Let me know if you'd like to meet and discuss this a bit more in-depth, since I think that would make the conversation a bit easier.
